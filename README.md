# HW1: Project Proposal

**Idea:** *My website will act as a place for users to log in and track how much they spend on “unnecessary”
purchases like food and entertainment.*

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this website is for people to have a more focused, visual representation on how
much money they are spending on items or food that they don’t need. In my mind, a typical user would
want to use my site to keep track of their spending habits and have certain averages available for them
to see without having to calculate personally. This concept is of interest to me because I have a habit of
overspending on unnecessary purchases. Like many young adults, I have worked a job while taking
classes and been able to save money during that time. As deposits, withdrawals, and purchases occur
over time, I tend to lose track of how much money I am actually spending. Some of the items could be
considered essential, but as a young adult, with no significant bills or expenses, a lot of the money is put
towards food, entertainment, and other miscellaneous items. I want to build this project because I feel
like it can be a reminder to people (of all ages, but especially young adults) that it’s easy to lose track of
your money when you make unnecessary purchases often. 

**Application:** The website will allow users to create and login to their profile. The profile will have basic information
like a username, age, and a profile picture. The main functionality of the website will essentially be a list
of items, each assigned to a category (like food, entertainment, or miscellaneous), with an amount of
money (USD) associated with it. Users will be able to add, delete, and modify these items to their own
personal list. The profiles on this site could be public for other users to see, however they may also be
private depending on the choice of the user. The goal for the design is to implement a calendar of some
design where items that are added will be associated with a specific date. This calendar aspect would
lead to the additional functionality of having averages for the list of items. This could include an average
for daily spending and monthly spending. 

**Application Name:** The name of the website will be “My Money is Gone”.
