# Project Description


**Title:**

*My Money is Gone*

**Summary:**

The *My Money is Gone* application provides a user with the ability to add entries that 
represent “unnecessary” purchases. Users will be able to create an account so that their entries are unique to their profiles. The purpose of this site is to help users highlight and track their “unnecessary” spending. Each user will have their unique perspective on what is “unnecessary”, so they will be able to fill in the entries based on how they feel about their purchase. The target population would be any users that spend money on a consistent basis and would like to track their purchases. The age demographic would be broad, ranging from teenagers to senior citizens. 

**Design Specifications:**

The design goal for my site was to be simple and welcoming. When I was developing the website aesthetic, I decided to rely on the color green as the main supporting color to the base white because U.S. currency is green. Considering that my site is supposed to be used for tracking purchases and understanding how a user spends their money, I felt that a bright and simple theme would be preferred. 

Future Work:

The *My Money is Gone* application is limited in its functionality at the moment, however, additional options for users can potentially be added. To make the application more complete, incorporating a function that allows the organization of entries by month, week, and year will offer users an organized way to view their “unnecessary” spending. This could be done by utilizing relational database queries with SQL database language and Java.
